This is a our project work for Topics in Applied Operational Research course which is co-taught by Dr. Miguel Anjos and Dr. Thomas Byrne at the University of Edinburgh(Spring 2021). Song Feng, Ishaan Singh Jolly and Jarold Montes Olivera are choosing to replicate the following article: Kayla Cummings, Banafsheh Behzad, Susan Martonosi (2020) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a Strategic Agent in the Pediatric Vaccine Market: An Analytical Approach.

## Week 4 : 
1. Parse data from the sources cited in the article 
2. Create a database to store the data 

## Week 5:  
1. Data cleaning and analysis to see general behaviour and patterns (if any) 
2. Start looking how to develop a mini case and what can be left out in terms of data without affecting the model 

## Week 6:  
1. Develop the model mini case


## Week 7:  
1. Mid semester report submission 
         

## Week 8:  
1. Run through analysis to check if the model is behaving correctly or not 
2. Forming and consolidating our models solutions 
3. Begin sensitivity analysis 

## Week 9:  
1. Finishing on senstivity analysis 
2. Transfer our results to a website(if possible and time allows) 

## Week 10:  
1. Analysis of result and discuss methods to go beyond the model 

## Week 11:  
1. Presentation and final report submission 


In doing all of our work we should be using BARON(MINLP solver hosted on NEOS), Xpress, Python, XML(for Data scrapping). We will add(and remove) this as we learn more about the project and as we form the minicase.
