This repository contains the following documents:

* *commands*: folder with the commands files to be used in NEOS server
* *data*: folder with the data files to be used in NEOS server
* *functions*: package with modules to generate trial data and recover the results obtained form NEOS.
* *model*: folder with the model files to be used in NEOS Server.
* *results*: folder with .txt files with the results extracted from NEOS.
* *Figure_2_and_4.ipynb*: Jupyter notebook with the code to generate figures 2 and 4 of the report.
* *process.ipynb*:  Jupyter notebook which employs package *functions* to generate data and recover the result from NEOS. It explains how to use the files in folders *commands*, *data* and *results*. It also generates Figures 3 and 5 of our report.
* *Business_net_income_2018.xlsx*: file with the business net income results for 2018 of Sanofi Pasteur. We used information form this file to derive target profit of this manufacturer.
